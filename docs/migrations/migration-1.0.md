## Eval mode renamed

**Affects:** Eval dataset JSON files that use `"mode": "llm_host"`.

The eval mode value `"llm_host"` was renamed to `"mcp_host"` to accurately reflect that this mode tests MCP tool calling behaviour, not the LLM itself.

### Before (v0.12.0)

```json
{
  "id": "search-trigger",
  "mode": "llm_host",
  "scenario": "Find recent documents about onboarding"
}
```

### After (v1.0.0)

```json
{
  "id": "search-trigger",
  "mode": "mcp_host",
  "scenario": "Find recent documents about onboarding"
}
```

To find all occurrences in your dataset files:

```bash
grep -r '"mode": "llm_host"' data/
```

## Judge provider alias removed

**Affects:** `EvalExpectBlock.passesJudge.provider`, `JudgeConfig.provider`

The `'claude'` string alias for the Anthropic judge provider has been removed. Use `'anthropic'` instead.

### Before (v0.11.x)

```typescript
const judge = createJudge({
  provider: 'claude',
  model: 'claude-sonnet-4-20250514',
});
```

```json
{
  "passesJudge": {
    "rubric": "correctness",
    "provider": "claude",
    "threshold": 0.75
  }
}
```

### After (v1.0.0)

```typescript
const judge = createJudge({
  provider: 'anthropic',
  model: 'claude-sonnet-4-20250514',
});
```

```json
{
  "passesJudge": {
    "rubric": "correctness",
    "provider": "anthropic",
    "threshold": 0.75
  }
}
```

### How to find affected code

```bash
grep -r '"claude"' evals/ tests/
grep -r "provider: 'claude'" src/ tests/
```

## LLM host: `'ollama'` provider removed

**Affects:** Eval datasets and code that set `mcpHostConfig.provider: 'ollama'`

The `'ollama'` value was listed in the `LLMProvider` union and accepted by the schema, but the underlying `@ai-sdk/ollama` package does not exist on npm — using it always resulted in a runtime error. The entry has been removed to avoid the misleading impression that it works.

### Mitigation options

**Option 1 — Switch to a supported provider.** If you were using Ollama as a local proxy for another model, configure one of the directly-supported providers instead (`'openai'`, `'anthropic'`, `'google'`, etc.).

**Option 2 — Use the community `ollama-ai-provider` package with a custom simulator.** The `ollama-ai-provider` package on npm provides a Vercel AI SDK-compatible adapter. Implement `MCPHostSimulator` and call it directly:

```typescript
import { createOllama } from 'ollama-ai-provider';
import { generateText } from 'ai';
import type {
  MCPHostSimulator,
  MCPHostSimulationResult,
} from '@gleanwork/mcp-server-tester';

const ollamaSimulator: MCPHostSimulator = {
  async simulate(mcp, scenario, config): Promise<MCPHostSimulationResult> {
    const ollama = createOllama({ baseURL: 'http://localhost:11434/api' });
    const tools = await mcp.listTools();

    const { text, toolCalls } = await generateText({
      model: ollama(config.model ?? 'llama3'),
      prompt: scenario,
      tools: buildVercelTools(tools, mcp),
      maxSteps: config.maxSteps ?? 10,
    });

    return {
      success: true,
      toolCalls: toolCalls.map(normalizeToolCall),
      response: text,
    };
  },
};
```

See [docs/mcp-host.md](../mcp-host.md) for the `MCPHostSimulator` interface details.

## Assertion accuracy metric renamed

**Affects:** Code that reads `EvalCaseResult.accuracy` programmatically.

The `accuracy` field on `EvalCaseResult` has been renamed to `assertionPassRate` to better reflect what it measures (the fraction of assertion checks that passed within a multi-iteration run). The old name was **removed outright** — there is no deprecated alias.

### Before (v0.11.x)

```typescript
const result = await runEvalDataset({ dataset }, { mcp, testInfo });

for (const caseResult of result.caseResults) {
  console.log(`${caseResult.id}: accuracy = ${caseResult.accuracy}`);
}
```

### After (v1.0.0)

```typescript
const result = await runEvalDataset({ dataset }, { mcp, testInfo });

for (const caseResult of result.caseResults) {
  console.log(`${caseResult.id}: pass rate = ${caseResult.assertionPassRate}`);
}
```

Update all references to use `assertionPassRate`. TypeScript will surface these as compile errors.

## Import path improvements (non-breaking)

This is not a breaking change. The top-level export now re-exports everything previously only available from subpath exports. Your existing imports continue to work without modification.

### What changed

`test` and other fixture helpers that previously required the subpath import are now available from the package root:

```typescript
// Previously required — still works
import { test } from '@gleanwork/mcp-server-tester/fixtures/mcp';

// Now also works — preferred for new code
import { test } from '@gleanwork/mcp-server-tester';
```

The subpath exports (`/fixtures/mcp`, `/fixtures/mcpAuth`, `/reporters/mcpReporter`) remain in place and continue to work.

---

## `env` field added to `StdioMCPConfig` (non-breaking)

This is not a breaking change. No action is required unless you want to use the new field.

`StdioMCPConfig` now accepts an optional `env` field — a `Record<string, string>` that is merged with `process.env` when the stdio subprocess is spawned. This is useful for injecting secrets or configuration without modifying your shell environment.

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  projects: [
    {
      name: 'my-server',
      use: {
        mcpConfig: {
          transport: 'stdio',
          command: 'node',
          args: ['./server.js'],
          env: {
            MY_SERVER_API_KEY: process.env.MY_SERVER_API_KEY ?? '',
            LOG_LEVEL: 'warn',
          },
        },
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

Variables in `env` override the corresponding `process.env` values for the child process only.
